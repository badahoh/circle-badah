                Bootstrapping by Bardini was a reading that I didn't particularly enjoy because I personally do not enjoy reading <button>historical content,</button> especially if the historical content has to do with a field that I don't understand. There were a lot of terms that I didn't understand and becuase I don't have a special passion for the origin for <code>computing</code> I didn't completely resonate or feel excited to learn about the innovations first made for the computing world. I wonder if this text was written differently it would be easier to understand. <i>I wonder how the engineers name each factor of their innovations</i>, what was the inspiration behind the term <strong>"mouse"? </strong> A tool we use commonly today.

               I agree that the paper was a difficult and heavy read. The question posed is interesting to think about because the names of common objects we use are never really questioned, especially an <small>invention like a mouse</small> It makes me think about the <b>connection</b> between the name of somethin and its function and whether this relation had any <sup>influence</sup> in naming the device. I agree fully too that I didn't really feel a connection to the reading, but it was still <span>interesting</span> to read for when I did understand things!
