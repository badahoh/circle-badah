            Flying fish are a group of about 50 species of fish that are found in tropical and subtropical waters around the world. They are named for their ability to leap out of the water and "fly" through the air, which they do to escape predators.

            It‚Äôs thought that flying fish evolved a flying mechanism to escape from their many oceanic predators. Once in the air, though, they sometimes become food for birds. Young flying fish may have filaments protruding from their lower jaws that camouflage them as plant blossoms.

            Flying fish are ray-finned fish with highly modified pectoral fins. Despite their name, flying fish aren‚Äôt capable of powered flight. Instead they propel themselves out of the water at speeds of more than 35 miles (56 kilometers) an hour. Once in the air, their rigid ‚Äúwings‚Äù allow them to glide for up to 650 feet (200 meters).

            Spawning takes place in the open ocean, near the water‚Äôs surface. A female deposits eggs, which are attached by sticky filaments to seaweed and floating debris. Newly hatched flying fish have whiskers near their mouths, which disguises them as plants, thus protecting them from predators. A flying fish lives for an average of five years.
