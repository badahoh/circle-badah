                The leafy seadragon is named for its appearance; its dragon-like body is covered in leaf-like projections that provide excellent camouflage. The species can grow up to 45 cm in length and is generally found in seaweed beds and rocky reefs in shallow coastal waters.

                This weird fish feeds on small crustaceans and plankton. Unfortunately, due to habitat loss, pollution, and collection for the aquarium trade, the population of leafy seadragons has been declining.

                Leafies are shaped to give themselves near-perfect camouflage in seaweed. But the leaf-like structures are not used for swimming. To move, this species uses two fins‚Äîone pectoral and one dorsal‚Äîthat <b>are so thin they are almost transparent.</b>

            <p>
                As with sea horses, sea dragon males are responsible for childbearing. But instead of a pouch, like sea horses have, male sea dragons have a spongy brood patch on the underside of the tail where females deposit their bright-pink eggs during mating. The eggs are fertilized during the transfer from the female to the male. The males incubate the eggs and carry them to term, releasing miniature sea dragons into the water after about four to six weeks.
