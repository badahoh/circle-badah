            Blue parrotfish are mainly blue with a yellow spot on their head that fades as they get older. Their teeth are fused together, giving them a beak-like jaw (somewhat resembles the beak of a parrot, thus its common name) The beak is used for scraping algae from rocks and other rocky surfaces. Their pharyngeal <b>teeth (throat teeth) are used for grinding rocks into sand.</b>

            Females will release fertilized eggs into the water column until they settle near the bottom. After they are released in the water, they will begin hatching after approximately 25 hours. Parrotfish can change sex from female to male.
