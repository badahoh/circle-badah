            The species is found in the waters of Ambon Island, and other Indonesian islands. It belongs to the frogfish family Antennariidae, all of which are predatory anglerfish

            The Psychedelic Frogfish is named for its strikingly bright and vibrant coloration, which includes bold patterns of red, yellow, and white. It has a flattened body, a large mouth, and a lure on its head with which it attracts prey.

            This weird fish is relatively small, reaching a maximum length of only about 9 centimeters. Despite its eye-catching appearance, little is known about the ecology or behavior of this species.

            Many frogfish, otherwise known as anglerfish, are known for violently gobbling their prey, and this far-out species is no different. He hides in tiny crevices of the coral, blocking off passages that shrimp and little fish use to get to inner chambers. The frogfishâ€™s thick skin protects him from scratches as he wriggles his way in to these tight spaces and waits â€” for unsuspecting prey to float by, when, in a flash, he swallows them whole.
