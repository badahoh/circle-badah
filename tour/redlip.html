            Batfish like to live on sandy or rubbly seabeds, and their highly modified pectoral fins allow them to <b>'walk'</b> with ease over the ocean floor - very odd behaviour for a fish!

            Although the majority of their time is spent on the seabed they do occasionally come to the surface and are also known to inhabit the edge of reefs. The Batfish tends to be found mostly on the west and south of the archipielago because it prefers colder water.

        <p>
            Being an angler fish, the Red-Lipped Batfish will display a fleshy growth on its head known as an illicium. It uses this to attract prey, including small crustaceans like shrimps, mollusks, and little fish.
