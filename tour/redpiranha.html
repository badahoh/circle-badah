            True to their name, red-bellied piranhas have red undersides. Their bodies are gray and flecked with bright, silver scales. Native to the Amazon River basin, these fish are important scavengers. They tend to travel in schools of 20 or more.

            Beneath the high forehead are powerful muscles that attach to a short, stout lower jaw fitted with triangular, razor sharp teeth, which interlock neatly with a matching set above. This design allows piranhas to bite down with incredible force and shearing ability. However, these formidable teeth are not usually visible, being covered by thick, fleshy lips.

            In the wild, a good portion of their diet consists of fins nipped from the tails of larger fish. Additional items on a piranha's menu can include bits of flesh, whole small fish, insects, aquatic invertebrates and occasionally, plant material in the form of figs and other ripe fruit.

            Red-bellied piranha reproduction begins with a courtship display involving swimming in circles. These piranhas are nest builders, with males creating bowl-shaped crevices in the sediment where eggs are placed. The eggs are laid in clusters and are attached to submerged aquatic vegetation. It is theorized that spawning could potentially correlate to the Amazon's wet season.
