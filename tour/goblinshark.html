                    Live goblin sharks have only rarely been observed and almost never filmed, so most of scientists‚Äô knowledge of this species is a result of their accidental capture in fisheries targeting other species. They are believed to be active predators and to take some fishes, as well as squids and pelagic crustaceans. When hunting, they identify prey below their sensitive rostrum and extend their jaws, far from their mouths, to grasp what they find. When feeding in this manner, they look more like something out of an alien movie than a shark.

                    Goblin sharks mate via internal fertilization and give live birth to a small number of relatively large young. Though they give live birth, these sharks do not connect to their young through a placenta. Instead, during the gestation period, the mother likely provides her young with unfertilized eggs that they actively eat for nourishment. After they are born, young goblin sharks are ready to be active predators. The goblin shark is not fished commercially, and is only rarely captured accidentally in fisheries targeting other species. Based on a recent analysis, scientists believe the goblin shark to be a species of least concern.
