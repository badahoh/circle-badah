                When it comes to selecting the cutest fish on the planet, there are many contenders. You might consider the usual suspects like clownfish, seahorses or rainbow parrotfish. However, you shouldn‚Äôt overlook this hidden gem: the yellow boxfish (Ostracion cubicum). With its adorable appearance that once served as inspiration for a car design (yes, really!), these fish offer more than meets the eye. Let‚Äôs delve into the world of the cute, agile and sometimes dangerous yellow boxfish
                The yellow boxfish certainly knows how to stand out in a crowd. It sports a bright yellow color and distinct black spots that serve as warnings to predators. Young boxfish display a more vibrant yellow and larger black spots, but their color fades, and their spots become less distinct as they age. Yellow boxfish typically grow to be 15-18 inches in adulthood.

                In addition to its color, the yellow boxfish lives up to its name in another way‚Äîit has rough, bony plates that encase its body in a box-like structure called a carapace. The carapace acts as armor and protects it from predators. The carapace is inflexible, and therefore the boxfish relies almost solely on its fins to swim. In theory, this rigid structure should make it difficult for the species to get around. However, the yellow boxfish gracefully navigates coral reefs with ease
                In addition to being sneakily nimble, the yellow boxfish has another surprise: when threatened, it can release a toxin from its skin that is potentially lethal to nearby fish. While this might not add to its ‚Äúcuteness‚Äù factor, it certainly helps keep predators at bay.
